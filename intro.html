    <h1>WaveLab Introduction</h1>



<P>WaveLab is a library of MATLAB routines for wavelet analysis, wavelet-
packet analysis, cosine-packet analysis and matching pursuit. The library
is available free of charge over the Internet. Versions are provided for
Macintosh, UNIX and Windows machines. 
<p>
WaveLab has been used in teaching courses in adapted wavelet analysis at
Stanford and at Berkeley. It is the basis for wavelet research by the authors,
and may be used to reproduce the figures in their published articles, and
to redo those figures with variations in the parameters. 
<p>
WaveLab has over 1200 files which are documented, indexed and cross- referenced
in various ways. MATLAB MEX files are used extensively to increase throughput.
<p>
In addition to routines implementing basic wavelet transforms for finite
data sets (both periodic transforms and boundary-corrected transforms),
wavelet-packet analysis, cosine-packet analysis and matching pursuit, the
library contains scripts which the authors believe will assist in learning
the practical aspects of wavelet analysis: 
<UL>
  <LI>Scripts that reproduce the figures in the authors' published articles,
including the de-noising articles of Donoho and Johnstone. 
  <LI>``Workouts'' that give a quick guide to wavelets (1-d and 2-d); wavelet
analysis; wavelet synthesis; wavelet and cosine packets, including the
Coifman-W ickerhauser
best-basis methodology; matching pursuit; and applications such as data
expansion, progressive data transmission, image compression, speech 
segmentation, de-noising, fast matrix multiplication in wavelet bases, etc. 
</UL>
WaveLab also offers: 
<UL>
  <LI>A library of datasets that are easily accessible to the user. Besides
artificial signals that have scientific or pedagogical appeal, real data
ranging from an image of Ingrid Daubechies to a recording by Enrico Caruso
are included. 
  <LI>A point-and-click browser that allows the user to select data, perform
various transforms or de-noising operations, and then see the results without
using the MATLAB command-line interface. 
  <LI>Extensive documentation, including on-line documentation for each
function, Contents files for each subdirectory, an <I>Architecture Guide </I>and an overview document, <I>About WaveLab,</I>
that introduces the software to a first-time user.
